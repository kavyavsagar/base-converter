<h3>Description</h3>

Angular 4 have 2 approaches on forms, one is Template driven forms and other is reactive or model-driven forms. Template-driven approach which is more easy to work with it. Reactive or model-driven approach for giving us more control, that results in a better testable form. 


In this application i am going to explain about Model driven forms which provides way for two way binding, detect changes in data and much more. It will show you how to do two way data binding and detecting changes by creating base converter single page web app.
